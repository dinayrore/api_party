# API Party!

The program entitled `request.rb` is a basic program that utilizes option parser to gather data from a third party API (PokÃ©api) AND very simple Rails API for Pokemon types (https://pokemon-types.herokuapp.com/types) to generate a Poke Report.  Your Poke Report will include data about a Pokemon you request and what other types of Pokemon it is and is not suited to battle.
